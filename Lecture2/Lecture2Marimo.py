    ## Identifiers

    Identifiers are the names given to entities like classes, functions, variables etc. in Python. It helps differentiate one entity from another. It is important to note that Python is case-sensitive.
    >Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute.
        Donald Knuth

    We should try to make our names easy to read and understand, this may be specific to a problem domain or using the "traditional" or "accepted" names for things (more on this when we talk about machine learning etc). Try to be clear and concise with your names.

    ## Data Types

    Python is a dynamically typed language, this means that variable values are checked at run-time (sometimes known as ‚Äúlazy binding‚Äù). All variables in Python hold references to objects, and these references are passed to functions by value.

    Python has 5 standard data types
      - numbers
      -  string
      -  list
      -  tuple
      -  dictionary


    ## Numbers

    Python supports 3 different numerical types:
    - int (signed integers)
    - float (floating point real values)
    - complex (complex numbers)

    ```sequence[start:stop:step]```

    ## Dictionaries

    Python dictionaries are a powerful key / value data structure which allows the storing of different data types in the same data set, they are also the core foundation on which the whole python language is built. Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ( ```{}``` ) and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces ( ```[]``` ).

    We use the key to access the value in the dictionary. The key must be unique and immutable (meaning it cannot be changed). The value can be any data type (including lists, tuples, and other dictionaries).

    It may take time to understand when and how to use dictionaries, but they are a powerful tool in python and are used extensively in the language.
